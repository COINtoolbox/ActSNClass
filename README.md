## Active Learning for Supernova Photometric Classification 

This repository holds the code and data used in [Optimizing spectroscopic follow-up strategies for supernova photometric classification with active learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.03765), by [Ishida](https://www.emilleishida.com), [Beck](https://github.com/beckrob), [Gonzalez-Gaitan](https://centra.tecnico.ulisboa.pt/team/?id=4337), [de Souza](https://www.rafaelsdesouza.com), [Krone-Martins](https://thegrid.ai/alberto-krone-martins/), [Barrett](http://jimbarrett.co.uk/), [Kennamer](https://github.com/NobleKennamer), [Vilalta](http://www2.cs.uh.edu/~vilalta/), [Burgess](https://grburgess.github.io/), [Quint](https://github.com/b1quint), [Vitorelli](https://github.com/andrevitorelli), [Mahabal](http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~aam/) and [Gangler](https://annuaire.in2p3.fr/agents/Y249R2FuZ2xlciBFbW1hbnVlbCxvdT1wZW9wbGUsZGM9aW4ycDMsZGM9ZnI=/show), 2018.

# Install

The current version runs in Python-3.7 or higher and it was not tested on Windows.  

We recommend that you work within a [virtual environment](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).  
 
You will need to install the `Python` package ``virtualenv``. In MacOS or Linux, do

    >> python3 -m pip install --user virtualenv

Navigate to a ``env_directory`` where you will store the new virtual environment and create it  

    >> python3 -m venv ActSNClass  

> Make sure you deactivate any ``conda`` environment you might have running before moving forward.   

Once the environment is set up you can activate it,

    >> source <env_directory>/bin/activate  

You should see a ``(ActSNClass)`` flag in the extreme left of terminal command line.   

Next, clone this repository in another chosen location:  

    (ActSNClass) >> git clone -b RESSPECT https://github.com/COINtoolbox/ActSNClassgit s.git  

Navigate to the repository folder and do  

    (ActSNClass) >> pip install -r requirements.txt  


You can now install this package with:  

    (ActSNClass) >>> python setup.py develop  

> You may choose to create your virtual environment within the folder of the repository. If you choose to do this, you must remember to exclude the virtual environment directory from version control using e.g., ``.gitignore``.
