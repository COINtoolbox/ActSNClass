To install:

clone the repository, get into it and type:  

python setup.py install --user


A script explaining how to use this is provided inside the repository [examples/runSNActClass.py](examples/runSNActClass.py)

# Important!!!!

Do not commit running code to this repository... all your running activities should be ran in the old repository (coinCF2017_SNClass). 

This is only for clean, code which is working and will be released with the final version. 


Also, although not mandatory it would be nice to keep [pep8 style guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) in mind.
