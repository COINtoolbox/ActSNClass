Welcome to actsnclass !
=======================



This tool allows you to reproduce the results presented in `Ishida et al., 2019 <https://cosmostatistics-initiative.org/portfolio-item/active-learning-for-sn-classification/>`_.
It was based on the original prototype developed during the `COIN Residence Program #4 <http://iaacoin.wixsite.com/crp2017/>`_ , which took place in Clermont Ferrand, France, August 2017.


The code has been updated to allow the inclusion of different modules and facilitate contributions.
